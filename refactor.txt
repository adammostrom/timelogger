Util should be helpers and be called upon by core modules, utils should not know the other modules.

CLI should handle all surface layer,

CLI -> timer
CLI -> logger
CLI -> logger -> utils 

NOT: 

Timer -> CLI -> utils 
CLI -> logger -> timer -> utils 
Timer -> Logger 

should be:

func CLI_Function(){

    call_timer_func()
    call_util_func()
    call_logger_func()
}

Module should only know about what it directly needs.


## DATA OWNERS
Timer own sessions
Logger own logs

CLI doesnt own any data, it only talks to the user 



Use interfaces in each hpp module

//timer.hpp

class Timer {
    public:
        void start();
        void stop();
        double elapsed();
}

These are interfaces.

## DEPENDENCY RULES

Higher level functions (CLI) can depend on lower level functions (Timer, Logger)

Low level should NOT depend on high level functions. 

Helpers/ utils should be pure (zero knowledge of the program itself).
