# TIMELOGGER


This is a simple log utility program for logging study hours, working hours etc. 
I made it primarily out of necessity to start logging my hours for both studies and work. I made it in C++ for learning reasons, and I also like C++.

The project is still a work in progress and it is gritty/messy. It works, but are in constant refinement.
